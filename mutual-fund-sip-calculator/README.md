## How to Use

### Basic Steps
1. **Enter Investment Details**:
   - Monthly investment amount (‚Çπ500 - ‚Çπ10,00,000)
   - Expected annual return rate (1% - 30%)
   - Investment period in years (1 - 50 years)
   - Choose SIP frequency (Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly)

### Input Guidelines
- **Monthly Investment**: Minimum ‚Çπ500, Maximum ‚Çπ10,00,000
- **Annual Return Rate**: Typical range 8% - 15% for equity funds
- **Investment Period**: 1 to 50 years
- **SIP Frequency**: Monthly is most common, but quarterly and yearly options available

## SIP Calculation Formula

The calculator uses the standard SIP formula:

```
FV = P √ó [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r] √ó (1 + r)
```

Where:
- **FV** = Future Value
- **P** = Periodic investment amount
- **r** = Periodic interest rate (annual rate / frequency)
- **n** = Total number of installments

### Example Calculation
For ‚Çπ5,000 monthly investment at 12% annual return for 10 years:
- P = ‚Çπ5,000
- r = 12% / 12 = 1% per month
- n = 10 √ó 12 = 120 months
- FV = ‚Çπ11,61,695 (approx)
